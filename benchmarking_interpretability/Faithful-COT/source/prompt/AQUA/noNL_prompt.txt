# Question: In a flight of 600 km, an aircraft was slowed down due to bad weather. Its average speed for the trip was reduced by 200 km/hr and the time of flight increased by 30 minutes. The duration of the flight is:
# Answer option: ['A)1 hour', 'B)2 hours', 'C)3 hours', 'D)4 hours', 'E)5 hours']
duration = Symbol('duration', positive=True)
delay = 30 / 60

original_speed = total_distance / duration
reduced_speed = total_distance / (duration + delay)
solution = solve_it(original_speed - reduced_speed - 200, duration)
answer = solution[duration]
