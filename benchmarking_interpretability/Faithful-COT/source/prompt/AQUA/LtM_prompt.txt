Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.
Answer Choices:
(a) 1/2
(b) 3/2
(c) 5/2
(d) 4/2
(e) 7/2
A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. What's b in terms of a?
Since a / b = 3/4, b = 4a / 3.
Q2. What's the result of substituting 4a / 3 for b in the second equation?
8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22.
Q3. What does the above equation simplify to?
This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22.
Final Answer: What's the value of a?
a is equal to 3/2. So the answer is (b).

Q: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?
Answer Choices:
(a) 1156
(b) 1392
(c) 1480
(d) 1562
(e) 1788
A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 9?
There are 9 one-digit numbers from 1 to 9. Each number requires one keystroke. So 9 keystrokes are needed.
Q2. How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 10 to 99?
There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. Each number requires two keystrokes. So 90*2=180 keystrokes are needed.
Q3. How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 100 to 500?
There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. Each number requires three keystrokes. So 401*3=1203 keystrokes are needed.
Final Answer: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?
9 + 180 + 1203 = 1392. So the answer is (b).

Q: Two friends plan to walk along a 43-km trail, starting at opposite ends of the trail at the same time. If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?
Answer Choices:
(a) 21
(b) 21.5
(c) 22
(d) 22.5
(e) 23
A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. What's the rate of Friend Q?
Let's say Friend Q's rate is x km/hr.
Q2. What's the rate of Friend P?
Friend P's rate is 1.15x km/hr.
Q3. How many kilometers do they walk together before they pass each other?
They walk 43 km together before they pass each other. So x + 1.15x = 43.
Final Answer: How many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?
Solving x + 1.15x = 43, we get x = 20. So Friend P will have walked 1.15*20 = 23 km. So the answer is (e).

Q: The entrance fee for a fair is $5 for persons under the age of 18, and 20% more for persons older. Each ride at the fair costs $0.50. If Joe goes with her 6 years old twin brothers, and they each took 3 rides in total. How much money does Joe end up spending at the fair?

Q: A cheese factory sells its cheese in rectangular blocks. A normal block has a volume of 8 cubic feet. If a small block has half the width, half the depth, and half the length of a normal block, what is the volume of cheese in a small block in cubic feet?
Answer Choices:
(a) 1
(b) 5
(c) 4
(d) 6
(e) 2
A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. What's the volume of a normal block?
The volume of a normal block is 8 cubic feet.
Q2. What's the volume of a small block?
The volume of a small block is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 of the volume of a normal block.
Final Answer: What's the volume of cheese in a small block in cubic feet?
The volume of cheese in a small block is 8*(1/8) = 1 cubic feet. So the answer is (a).
