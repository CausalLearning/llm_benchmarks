# Q: In a fruit salad, there are raspberries, green grapes, and red grapes. There are seven more than 3 times the number of red grapes as green grapes. There are 5 less raspberries than green grapes. If there are 102 pieces of fruit in the salad, how many red grapes are in the salad?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
# 1. How many green grapes are there?
