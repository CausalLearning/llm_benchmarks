# Q: There were 90 people at the summer picnic. There were 50 soda cans, 50 plastic bottles of sparkling water, and 50 glass bottles of juice. One-half of the guests drank soda, one-third of the guests drank sparkling water, and four-fifths of the juices were consumed. How many recyclable cans and bottles were collected?
