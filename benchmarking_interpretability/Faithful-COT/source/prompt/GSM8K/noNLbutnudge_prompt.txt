# Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
trees_begin = 15
trees_end = 21
trees_today = trees_end - trees_begin
answer = trees_today

# Q: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
computers_begin = 9
computers_each_day = 5
days_monday_to_thursday = 4
computers_new = 0
for i in range(days_monday_to_thursday):
    computers_new += computers_each_day

answer = computers_now

# Q: Danny has 3 bottles of soda. He drinks 90% of one bottle and gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends. How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
fraction_bottle_drink = 0.9
fraction_bottle_give = 0.7
fraction_bottle_drink_left = 1 - fraction_bottle_drink
fraction_bottle_give_left = (1 - fraction_bottle_give) * 2
fraction_soda_left = fraction_bottle_drink_left + fraction_bottle_give_left
percent_soda_left = fraction_soda_left * 100
answer = percent_soda_left

# Q: In a fruit salad, there are raspberries, green grapes, and red grapes. There are seven more than 3 times the number of red grapes as green grapes. There are 5 less raspberries than green grapes. If there are 102 pieces of fruit in the salad, how many red grapes are in the salad?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
green_grapes = Symbol("green_grapes")
red_grapes = 3 * green_grapes + 7
raspberries = green_grapes - 5
total_fruit_eq = Eq(green_grapes + red_grapes + raspberries, 102)
green_grapes_val = solve_it(total_fruit_eq, green_grapes)[green_grapes]
red_grapes_val = red_grapes.subs(green_grapes, green_grapes_val)
answer = red_grapes_val

# Q: Denise will be 25 years old in two years. Her sister, Diane, is 4 years younger. In how many years will Diane be 25 years old?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
age_denise_in_2y = 25
age_denise_now = age_denise_in_2y - 2
age_diane_now = age_denise_now - 4
years_until_diane_25 = 25 - age_diane_now
answer = years_until_diane_25

# Q: There were 90 people at the summer picnic. There were 50 soda cans, 50 plastic bottles of sparkling water, and 50 glass bottles of juice. One-half of the guests drank soda, one-third of the guests drank sparkling water, and four-fifths of the juices were consumed. How many recyclable cans and bottles were collected?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
people = 90
soda_cans = 50
sparkling_water_bottles = 50
juice_bottles = 50
soda_consumed = people * 1/2
sparkling_water_consumed = people * 1/3
juices_consumed = juice_bottles * 4/5
cans_and_bottles_collected = soda_consumed + sparkling_water_consumed + juices_consumed
answer = cans_and_bottles_collected

# Q: Mark has an egg farm. His farm supplies one store with 5 dozen eggs and another store with 30 eggs each day. How many eggs does he supply these two stores in a week?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
n_in_dozen = 12
eggs_one_store_each_day = 5 * n_in_dozen
eggs_another_store_each_day = 30
days_in_week = 7
eggs_week = 0
for i in range(days_in_week):
    eggs_week += eggs_one_store_each_day + eggs_another_store_each_day
answer = eggs_week

# Q: Rebecca makes her own earrings out of buttons, magnets, and gemstones. For every earring, she uses two magnets, half as many buttons as magnets, and three times as many gemstones as buttons. If Rebecca wants to make 4 sets of earrings, how many gemstones will she need?
# To answer this question, write a Python program to answer the following subquestions:
magnets_per_earring = 2
earrings_per_set = 2
magnets_per_set = magnets_per_earring * earrings_per_set
buttons_per_set = magnets_per_set * 1/2
gemstones_per_set = buttons_per_set * 3
gemstones_4_sets = gemstones_per_set * 4
answer = gemstones_4_sets
