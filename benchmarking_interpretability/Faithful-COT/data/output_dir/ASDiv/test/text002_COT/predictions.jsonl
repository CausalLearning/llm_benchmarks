We also know that when the father's age is equal to the son's age, the total of their ages will be 93. So, we have F + F = 93. We can solve this by subtracting S from both sides. We get F + F - S = 93 - S. This becomes 2F - S = 93 - S. We can add S to both sides to get 2F = 93. We can divide both sides by 2 to get F = 93 / 2. This means that the father's age is 46.5 years. The son's age must be 55 - 46.5 = 8.5 years."]}
