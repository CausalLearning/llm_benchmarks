We have the equation:\n\n15L + 7S = 134\n\nWe want to minimize the number of trucks, so we want to maximize the number of large trucks. We can start by finding the maximum number of large trucks that can be used without exceeding 134 tons:\n\n134 ÷ 15 ≈ 8.93\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a truck, we can use at most 8 large trucks. Now let's see if we can find a suitable number of small trucks to fill the remaining capacity:\n\n15 * 8 = 120\n\n134 - 120 = 14\n\nNow we can see that we need 14 more tons to reach 134 tons.
