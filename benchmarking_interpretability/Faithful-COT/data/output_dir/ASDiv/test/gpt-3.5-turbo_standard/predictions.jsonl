Let's call the distance \"d\" and the original rate of walking \"r\".\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we know that:\n\nd/r - d/(r+1/2) = 1\n\nThis is because if the man walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hour less. The equation represents the time it takes to walk the distance at the original rate (d/r) minus the time it takes to walk the same distance at the faster rate (d/(r+1/2)). The difference between these times is 1 hour.\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we know that:\n\nd/r + 3 = d/(r-1)\n\nThis is because if the man walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. The equation represents the time it takes to walk the distance at the original rate (d/r) plus 3 hours, which is equal to the time it takes to walk the same distance at the slower rate (d/(r-1)).\n\nNow we can solve for both \"d\" and \"r\" using these two equations.

Similarly, each set of blue flyers has 20 flyers, so the total number of blue flyers she distributed is 20y. \n\nWe also know that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers, so:\n\n13x = 20y \n\nTo find the minimum values of x and y that satisfy this equation, we can look for the smallest pair of integers that have a ratio of 13:20.

Let's say Tayli gave out x packs of red flyers and y sets of blue flyers. We know that each pack of red flyers has 13 flyers, so the total number of red flyers she distributed is 13x. Similarly, each set of blue flyers has 20 flyers, so the total number of blue flyers she distributed is 20y. \n\nWe also know that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers, so:\n\n13x = 20y \n\nTo find the minimum values of x and y that satisfy this equation, we can look for the smallest pair of integers that have a ratio of 13:20. This pair is x = 20 and y = 13, which gives us:\n\n13x = 13(20) = 260 red flyers \n20y = 20(13) = 260 blue flyers \n\nSo Tayli distributed a minimum of 260 red flyers and 260 blue flyers."]}
