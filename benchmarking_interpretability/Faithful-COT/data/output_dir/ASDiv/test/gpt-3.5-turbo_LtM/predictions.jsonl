How long was each piece of ribbon?\nEach piece of ribbon was 73 cm long.\nQ3. How many pieces of ribbon did Sam cut?\nWe don't know how many pieces of ribbon Sam cut, but we can calculate it by dividing the length of the original ribbon by the length of each piece: 3,730 / 73 = 51.23. Since Sam can't cut a fraction of a ribbon, we can assume he cut 51 pieces of ribbon.\nFinal Answer: How much of the original ribbon was left?\nSam used 51 * 73 = 3,723 cm of ribbon. Therefore, there was 3,730 - 3,723 = 7 cm of ribbon left. The answer is 7 cm."]}

What is the formula for the perimeter of an equilateral triangle?\nThe formula for the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is P = 3s, where s is the length of one side.\nQ3. What is the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle?\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.\nFinal Answer: What is the perimeter of the field?\nTo find the perimeter of the field, we need to first find the width of the rectangular region. Since the width and the side of the equilateral triangle are the same, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the width:\nw^2 + (s/2)^2 = s^2\nw^2 + (42/2)^2 = 42^2\nw^2 + 21^2 = 42^2\nw^2 = 42^2 - 21^2\nw^2 = 1233\nw ≈ 35.1 ft\nNow we can find the perimeter of the field:\nPerimeter = 2(l + w) + 3s\nPerimeter = 2(76 + 35.1) + 3(42)\nPerimeter = 152 + 70.2 + 126\nPerimeter = 348.2 ft\nThe perimeter of the field is 348.2 ft."]}
