We know that the total number of animals is the sum of camels and dromedaries, so:\n\nC + D = total number of animals\n\nWe also know that the total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180, so:\n\nC + D = 180\n\nWe also know that the total number of bumps is the number of camels times 2 (since camels have 2 humps each) plus the number of dromedaries (since dromedaries have 1 hump each), so:\n\n2C + D = 304\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:\n\nC + D = 180\n2C + D = 304\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\nC = 124\n\nNow we know there are 124 camels. We can substitute this into either equation to find the number of dromedaries:\n\n124 + D = 180\nD = 56\n\nSo there are 56 dromedaries. The answer is 56."]}
