Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, it eats 16 miles * 1/2 bail of hay per mile = 8 bails of hay.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much the hay costs. Since a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much money Michael has left. He has six 5 dollar bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30. So, after buying the hay, he has $30 - $24 = $6 left."]}
