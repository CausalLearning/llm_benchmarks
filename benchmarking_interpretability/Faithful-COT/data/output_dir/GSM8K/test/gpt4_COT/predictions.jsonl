Then, we can substitute the third equation into this new equation to get (3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341.\n\nCombining the terms, we get 7P + 12 = 341. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 7P = 329. Dividing both sides by 7, we get P = 47.\n\nNow that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has by using the third equation: S = 3P = 3 * 47 = 141.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of cards Becca has by using the second equation: B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.\n\nSo, Becca has 153 cards."]}

She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money she needs for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary during her retirement, which is 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.\n\nNow, we need to find out the total amount of money she needs for her 20-year retirement period. She needs $40,000 per year for 20 years, which is $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many more years she needs to work to save this amount. She saves $20,000 per year, so she needs to work for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years to save enough for her retirement.\n\nSince we are asked for how many more years she needs to work, we need to subtract her current years of work from the total years needed. Assuming she has not started working yet, she needs to work for 40 more years. The answer is 40."]}
