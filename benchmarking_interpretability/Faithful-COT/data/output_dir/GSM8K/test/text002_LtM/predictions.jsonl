How many cups were bought?\n20 dozen cups were bought.\nQ4. How much did each cup cost?\n\nTo calculate the cost of each cup, we need to first calculate the total cost of the plates and cups. The total cost of the plates is 6*6000 = $36000. The total cost of the cups is 20*12*C, where C is the cost of each cup. We know that the total cost of the plates and cups is $36000 + 20*12*C = $60000. Therefore, 20*12*C = $60000 - $36000 = $24000. Therefore, C = $24000/20/12 = $2.
