How many games did the football team win?\nThey won 8 more than they lost, so they won x + 8 games. \nQ3. How many games did the football team play in total?\nThe football team played 22 games in total. \nFinal Answer: How many games did the football team win?\nWe know that they won x + 8 games and that they played 22 games in total. So we can set up the equation: \nx + (x + 8) = 22\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n2x + 8 = 22\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get: \n2x = 14\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \nx = 7\nSo the football team lost 7 games. To find out how many games they won, we can use the equation we set up earlier: \nx + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15\nTherefore, the football team won 15 games. The answer is 15.", "completions": ["Q1.

How many bees that left before the last 6 hours returned in the last 6 hours?\nAll the bees that left before the last 6 hours returned in the last 6 hours.\nFinal Answer: How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?\nDebra saw 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees leave the hive during the day. Since all the bees that left before the last 6 hours returned in the last 6 hours, Debra saw 105 - 60 = 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours. The answer is 45."]}

How many cookies did Sue eat on Monday?\nSue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4*5 = 20 cookies.\nQ4. How many cookies did Sue eat on Tuesday?\nSue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so she ate 2*13 = 26 cookies.\nQ5. How many more calories did Sue consume than her sister?\nIf 1 cookie has 200 calories, then Sue consumed (20+26)*200 = 9200 calories in total, while her sister consumed (5+13)*200 = 3600 calories in total. Therefore, Sue consumed 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister. The answer is 5600."]}

How many times higher can Naruto lift a mountain compared to Kagiyami?\nNaruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.\nFinal Answer: How high can Naruto lift a mountain, in feet?\nFirst, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1 inch is equal to 1/12 feet. Therefore, Pompei can lift a mountain 1/12 feet high. \nSaskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so he can lift a mountain (12/1) * (1/12) = 1 foot high. \nKagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so he can lift a mountain (4/1) * 1 = 4 feet high. \nNaruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so he can lift a mountain (10/1) * 4 = 40 feet high. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high. The answer is 40.", "completions": ["Q1. How high can Pompei lift a mountain?\nPompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.\nQ2.

How many women alighted from the bus at the next stop?\n20 women alighted from the bus at the next stop.\nFinal Answer: How many women have remained on the bus?\nFirst, we need to find the number of men on the bus. We can do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the sum of the ratio parts (5+9) and multiplying by the ratio part for men (5). This gives us (5/14)*84 = 30 men. \nNow we can find the number of women on the bus by subtracting the number of men from the total number of passengers: 84 - 30 = 54. \nFinally, we can subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus from the total number of women on the bus: 54 - 20 = 34 women.
