{"id": 314, "answer": "[invalid]", "completion": " We know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. We also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. We can set up the equation 2x = y, where x is the number of players on the defense and y is the number of players on the offense. We also know that y/2 = z, where z is the number of players on the special teams. We can plug this into our original equation and we get 2x = y and 2x = y/2. We can solve this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, which cancels out the 2 on the left side. This leaves us with just x = y/2. We know that y = 2x, so we can plug this in and we get x = (2x)/2. This simplifies to x = x, which means that the number of players on the defense is equal to the number of players on the offense. We know that the number of players on the offense is 2x, so the number of players on the defense is also 2x. We also know that the number of players on the special teams is y/2, which is also 2x. So the number of players on the defense is 2x, the number of players on the offense is 2x, and the number of players on the special teams is 2x. The total number of players on the team is 105. So we have 3x = 105. We can solve this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which cancels out the 3 on the left side. This leaves us with just x = 105/3. We can simplify this to x = 35.

{"id": 909, "answer": "34", "completion": " Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This means that 8 years ago, Duncan was 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago). We don't know Adam's age 4 years ago, but we do know that Duncan is 60 now. So 8 years ago, Duncan was 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago) and now Duncan is 60. This means that 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago) + 8 = 60. We can solve for Adam's age 4 years ago by subtracting 8 from both sides. This gives us 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago) = 60 - 8.
