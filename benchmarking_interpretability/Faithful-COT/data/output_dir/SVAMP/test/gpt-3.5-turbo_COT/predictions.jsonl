We know that she gave away some Ace cards, so she must have 18 - x Ace cards left, where x is the number of Ace cards she gave to Jeff. We also know that she has 178 baseball cards left, so she must have given away 438 - 178 = 260 baseball cards. We can set up an equation to solve for x:\n\nx + 55 = 18 - x + 260\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2x = 187\n\nx = 93.5\n\nSince x must be a whole number, we know that Nell gave away 93 Ace cards. Therefore, she has 18 - 93 = -75 Ace cards left (which doesn't make sense, since she can't have negative cards). This means that our assumption that she gave away some Ace cards was incorrect. Instead, she must have given away all of her Ace cards, and she has 178 baseball cards left. Therefore, she has 178 more baseball cards than Ace cards. The answer is 178."]}
