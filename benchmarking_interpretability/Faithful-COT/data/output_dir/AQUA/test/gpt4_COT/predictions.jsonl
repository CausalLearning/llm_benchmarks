The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by Sn = n/2 * (a1 + an), where Sn is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nIn this case, Sn = 250, a1 = 7, and the common difference d = 3/12 = 0.25 years. We can find the last term an using the formula an = a1 + (n-1)d.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the sum formula, we get:\n\n250 = n/2 * (7 + an)\n\nWe know that an = 7 + (n-1) * 0.25, so we can substitute this expression for an in the sum formula:\n\n250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n-1) * 0.25 - 7)\n250 = n/2 * (7 + (n-1) * 0.25)\n\nNow we can solve for n:\n\n500 = n * (7 + (n-1) * 0.25)\n500 = 7n + 0.25n^2 - 0.25n\n0 = 0.25n^2 - 6.75n + 500\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nn = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 0.25, b = -6.75, and c = 500:\n\nn = (6.75 ± √((-6.75)^2 - 4 * 0.25 * 500)) / (2 * 0.25)\nn = (6.75 ± √(45.5625 - 500)) / 0.5\nn = (6.75 ± √(-454.4375)) / 0.5\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, there is no real solution for n. However, we can approximate the value of n by ignoring the negative square root:\n\nn ≈ (6.75 + √(45.5625)) / 0.5\nn ≈ (6.75 + 6.75) / 0.5\nn ≈ 13.5 / 0.5\nn ≈ 27\n\nSo there are approximately 27 members in the club.
