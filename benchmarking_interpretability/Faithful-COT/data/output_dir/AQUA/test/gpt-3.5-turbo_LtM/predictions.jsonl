What's the initial number of water lilies?\nThe initial number of water lilies is 64.\nQ3. What's the final number of water lilies?\nThe final number of water lilies is 64 * 2^30.\nFinal Answer: In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?\nTo find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, we need to find the number of days it takes for the initial number of water lilies to double 30 times.

Then we have 0.6 * x = 0.6x as the probability that both A and B occur.\nQ3. What's the probability that only B occurs?\nThe probability that only B occurs is P(B) - P(A and B).

If we let the length be x and the width be y, then we have xy = 240. Since one side is 10 meters, we have x = 10 + y. Substituting this into the equation xy = 240, we get (10 + y)y = 240. Solving for y, we get y = 12 meters.\nQ2.
