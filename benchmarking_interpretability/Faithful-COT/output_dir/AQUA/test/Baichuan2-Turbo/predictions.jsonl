Since the numbers are consecutive, odd, and two-digit, we can represent them as `n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2`, where `n` is the middle number and `n` is odd and between 11 (the smallest odd two-digit number) and 99 (the largest odd two-digit number).\n\n2.

Since `n` is odd, `5n` will also be odd, and thus `S` cannot end in zero. Therefore, `n` must be even.\n\n4. Now, since `n` is even, we can write `n = 2k`, where `k` is an integer. So, `S = 5n = 10k` which means `S` is indeed divisible by 10.\n\n5. Now, we need to find `k` such that `S/10` is a perfect square. We can iterate over possible values of `k` from 1 to 9 (since `n` is in the range 10 to 98, inclusive), calculate `S`, and check if `S/10` is a perfect square.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nfrom math import sqrt\n\n# Define the symbols\nk = sp.Symbol('k', integer=True, positive=True)\n\n# Function to check if a number is a perfect square\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    return int(sqrt(n))**2 == n\n\n# Possible ranges for k\nfor k in range(1, 10):  # Since n = 2k, n will be in the range 2*1 .. 2*9\n    S = 10 * k  # S = 5n, and since n = 2k, S = 10k\n    if is_perfect_square(S // 10):\n        n = 2 * k\n        # Check if n is a two-digit odd number\n        if 10 < n < 100 and n % 2 == 1:\n            print(f\"One of the five numbers is: {n}\")\n            break\n\n# Note: This code assumes that there is at least one set of numbers that satisfy the conditions.\n```\n\nThis code will output one of the five numbers from the sequence that satisfies the given condition. Keep in mind that there might be more than one correct answer based on the provided options."]}
